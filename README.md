# EUR-USD-Data-Analysis
This was my first major data project. I was working with a data set with about 150 million row of tick data. 
I performed 2 different scrubing algorithms scanning for long term and short term variblity and removed ticks that represented 
random spikes in the data. Both scrubbing algorithms I implemented in both MySQL and Python.
After this I simulated basic trading strategics buy and selling the 100, 500, 1000, etc. tick min and max and cummulating 
Pnl over the entire data set.
